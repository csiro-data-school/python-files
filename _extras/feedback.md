## Modules

### **UP**
Daniel good presenter, speed OK. Also useful asides as we went along.

Importing modules

Interesting content and shortcuts.

Very good explanation of concepts.

Useful things to learn to see the difference between small changes in commands.

clear logic and described in detail. I feel as if I understand how the packages work and feel confident importing packages.

+1 to last comment. Also, it is nice to have some background as to how languages developed

after being so confused yesterday afternoon it felt to understand what was happening

good info on inporting modules

### **DOWN**
I was a bit slow setting directory in git bash (me not presenter)

Nees to be more focussed, relatively easy process but rabbit holes 
are too long. OK to follow questions but not too long.

Not much really.

A little slow at times.

A few too many tangents about information.

could go through some of the content a little quicker, like namespaces/conflicts

### **Timing**

1.5 h

## Module exercise

### **UP**

this information is hard but we all need it

a bit slow in parts

## IO

### **UP**

Afternoon session. My brain was weakening. Thinking slowly. 

had the for loop for the . .. ... ... exercise, new there should have been something I could automate it with, but could not
get it to happen.
